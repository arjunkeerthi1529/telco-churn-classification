# 📊 Telco Customer Churn Classification

## 📌 1. Problem Statement

Customer churn is a major challenge in the telecom industry. When customers discontinue services, companies lose recurring revenue and must spend additional resources to acquire new customers.

The objective of this project is to build, evaluate, and compare multiple machine learning classification models to predict whether a telecom customer will churn based on demographic, service usage, and billing-related features.

This project also includes deployment of the trained models using a Streamlit web application.

## 📂 2. Dataset Description

**Dataset Used:** Telco Customer Churn Dataset  
**Total Instances (after cleaning):** 7032  
**Original Features:** 20  
**Features After Encoding:** 30  

### Important Features Include:

- Gender  
- SeniorCitizen  
- Partner  
- Dependents  
- Tenure  
- PhoneService  
- InternetService  
- OnlineSecurity  
- Contract  
- MonthlyCharges  
- TotalCharges  
- PaymentMethod  

### Target Variable:

**Churn**
- 1 → Customer Churned  
- 0 → Customer Stayed  

---

## 🧹 3. Data Preprocessing

The following preprocessing steps were performed:

- Removed 11 rows with missing `TotalCharges`
- Converted `TotalCharges` to numeric
- One-hot encoding for categorical features
- Train-test split (80% training, 20% testing)
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler (for Logistic Regression, KNN, and Naive Bayes)

## 🤖 4. Machine Learning Models Implemented

Six classification models were trained and evaluated:

1. Logistic Regression  
2. Decision Tree  
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
4. Naive Bayes  
5. Random Forest  
6. XGBoost  

All models were trained on the same dataset split for fair comparison.

## 📏 5. Evaluation Metrics

Each model was evaluated using the following metrics:

- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1 Score  
- AUC (Area Under ROC Curve)  
- MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient)  

These metrics help measure both prediction performance and handling of class imbalance.

| Model | Accuracy | AUC | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | MCC |
|--------|----------|------|------------|--------|----------|------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.8038 | 0.8357 | 0.6476 | 0.5749 | 0.6091 | 0.4803 |
| Decision Tree | 0.7093 | 0.6403 | 0.4543 | 0.4652 | 0.4597 | 0.2609 |
| KNN | 0.7527 | 0.7661 | 0.5357 | 0.5214 | 0.5285 | 0.3609 |
| Naive Bayes | 0.6446 | 0.8102 | 0.4184 | 0.8636 | 0.5637 | 0.3808 |
| Random Forest | 0.7896 | 0.8176 | 0.6364 | 0.4866 | 0.5515 | 0.4237 |
| XGBoost | 0.7790 | 0.8348 | 0.5994 | 0.5080 | 0.5499 | 0.4072 |

## 🔎 7. Model Observations

| ML Model Name | Observation about Model Performance |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| Logistic Regression | Achieved the best overall balanced performance with highest Accuracy (0.8038) and MCC (0.4803). Demonstrated strong generalization ability and stable predictions on this dataset. |
| Decision Tree | Showed lower performance compared to other models. Likely overfitting due to high variance, resulting in weaker generalization and lower AUC (0.6403). |
| kNN | Performed moderately well. Sensitive to feature scaling and distance metric. Accuracy and F1 were better than Decision Tree but lower than ensemble models. |
| Naive Bayes | Achieved very high Recall (0.8636) but lower Precision, meaning it detects most churn cases but produces more false positives. Suitable when recall is prioritized. |
| Random Forest (Ensemble) | Improved performance over single Decision Tree. Reduced overfitting and achieved strong Accuracy (0.7896) and AUC (0.8176), though Recall remained moderate. |
| XGBoost (Ensemble) | Delivered high AUC (0.8348) and strong overall performance. Effective gradient boosting improved predictive capability, though slightly lower Accuracy than Logistic Regression. |


Overall, Logistic Regression provided the best balance of accuracy, AUC, and MCC for this dataset.
